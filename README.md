This is a first version of our Kompendium, work is still in progress.

You may use it as an open educational resource and edit your own version with R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for an introduction.

You can find the preview of the Kompendium at https://janssent.github.io/kompendium-bkdwn/, a formally published version will be available at the homepage of the AG Didaktik by October 2018.
